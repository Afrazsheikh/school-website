      <p>Admission of students to kindergarten and school is carried out on a competitive basis based on the results of the input diagnostics - an interview with a psychologist and a primary school teacher for intellectual potential and readiness for learning.</p>
      <p>Before entering primary school, the child is interviewed. We will not meticulously test it. We'll just talk. About what he likes to do, what fascinates him, about friends, favorite activities and other entertaining things. Later we will offer several tests, while taking care that the baby is interested in working with them. Older children will get more difficult tests, but here we will make sure that in case of failure, the child would not feel upset.</p>
      <p>We may need several meetings to get a reliable impression of the child's level of preparation. Our school works according to a rather complex program, and when accepting a child in the second or higher grade, it is important for us to make sure that he can feel comfortable there. Often, if a child's level of preparation does not match the level of the class, we will offer a program of additional activities that will help the child bridge the gap..</p>
